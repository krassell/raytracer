Simple raytracer

Originally made as part of Bachelor degree work, hence some naming.
Visual Studio 2010 Express project file included.

Features: 
 - Graphical User Interface.
 - Small self-contained vector library.
 - Simple .scene files for scene description, examples provided.
 - Point lights.
 - Reflective and refracting surfaces.
 - Basic primitives of sphere, infinite plane and triangle.
 - Rudimentary loading of .obj files, as a form of triangle array. Textures, per-color-reflectivity and uv's are ignored.

Special thanks for Jacco Bikker for neat example that helped resolving issues with image drawing and refraction.
